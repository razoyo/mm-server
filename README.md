# mm-server

This is a little Node/Express application that is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi.  It takes a picture of a barcode and reads the barcode in the picture.

## Requirements
- You should be running Node 6+ 

## Install

- Clone the repository with git
- cd into the mm-server directory it creates
- npm install
- use 'npm run watch' to run on your environment
- go to localhost:3000 on your browser
- Make sure the .env file downloads with the clone. If it doesn't, it should look like this: 
```
E_ENV=development
PORT=3000
SOCKET_PORT=3200
PICTURE_PATH=dist/assets/customer-photos
PICTURE_SUFFIX=.jpg
PEM_FILE=~/.ssh/cloud-node.pem
CLOUD_USER=bitnami
CLOUD_URL=localhost:5000
```

*Notes if working on Mac*:  If you want to run this on your Mac instead of the Raspberry Pi:
 - The `POST /api/picture` likely won't work because you don't have raspistill
 - If you don't have the Mirror App in the dist directory, the PICTURE_PATH should be set to a directory that can be made, eg. `customer-photos`. 
 
- Run the code
For development:
```
npm run watch
```
or:
```
node server.js
```

## Routes

```
PUT '/api/barcode'
```
This is hardcoded to return '123456'.  I left it there as an example of how to add a new module and route.
```
POST '/api/picture'
```
This accepts a body like this:
```
{
  "directory": "paul",    // required
  "base_name": "camera",  // optional - basename of image, default is 'camera'
  "options": {            // optional - options for raspistill
    "rot": "180",
    "quality": "100"
  }
}
``` 
It uses PICTURE_PATH. If PICTURE_PATH="images", then the above body will execute the raspistill command like this:
```
raspistill -rot 180 --quality 100 -o images/paul/camera80417
```
The '80417' on the end of the filename is the hour, minute, second the picture was taken.  This route will respond with the path of the picture as in "images/paul/camera80417"
